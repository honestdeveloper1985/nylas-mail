Nylas Mail is built on top of Atom Shell, which runs the latest version of Chromium (at the time of writing, Chromium 41). You can access the standard Chrome Developer Tools using the Command-Option-I keyboard shortcut. When you open the developer tools, you'll also notice a bar appear at the bottom of the window. This bar allows you to inspect API requests sent from the app, streaming updates received from the Nylas API, and tasks that are queued for processing with the `TaskQueue`.

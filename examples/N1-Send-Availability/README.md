## Who?

This package annotated for those who are familiar with React, Flux already, and have already seen other N1 packages. This package is more complicated than the other packages, as it demonstrates how arbitrary JavaScript can be inserted to create custom functionality.

## Why?

When making appointments with other people, you need to share your availabilities in order to schedule a time.

## What?

This is a package that allows you to email times that you are free to other people to make it easier to schedule appointments. The package adds an "Add Availability" button next to the "Send" button. The button opens a calendar, in which you can select time periods to email to other people.

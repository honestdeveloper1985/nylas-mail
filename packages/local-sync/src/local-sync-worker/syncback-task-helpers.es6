  * that we don't  run 2 tasks that will affect the same set of UIDS together,
  * i.e. without running a sync loop in between them.
  *
  * For example, if there's a task to change the labels of a message, and also
  * a task to move that message to another folder, we need to run the label
  * change /first/, otherwise the message would be moved and it would receive a
  * new IMAP uid, and then attempting to change labels with an old uid would
  * fail.
  *
  * TODO NOTE: This function excludes Send tasks because these are run outside fo the
  * sync loop for performance reasons.

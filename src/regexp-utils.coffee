  # It's important that the regex be wrapped in parens, otherwise
  # javascript's RegExp::exec method won't find anything even when the

  # It's also imporant we return a fresh copy of the RegExp every time. A
  # javascript regex is stateful and multiple functions using this method
  # will cause unexpected behavior!
